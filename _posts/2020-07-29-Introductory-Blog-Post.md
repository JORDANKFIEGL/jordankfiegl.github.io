In an effort to stay current, I have finally gotten around to making a webpage. I am vowing, both to myself and to anyone reading this, that this will not become a content farm.
I have no aspirations to becoming a LinkedIn data science influencer. Rather, I plan to post the occasional career update/reflection as well as topics that I find to be worth writing out.

			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>I obtained an MS in biostatics in 2019. Since then, I've been working as a data scientist within the University Hospitals Health System. My domain interests are somewhat agnostic, however I have a strong interest in using statistics and machine learning in a reproducible way that generates good for those who use the data products we create. I'm currently living in Cleveland, Ohio. I live with my lab/pitbull mix Einstein. When I'm not working on my day job, I usually have one or two side projects I'm working on. I'm also an avid outdoorsman: I enjoy trail-running, bicycling, and backpacking.</p>
